## Application: Damn That Was Hard
### **Purpose**
The purpose of the app was to inspire and build connections with people. This was done by providing a website where users could write stories 
and share them with others. The main concept of these stories were that they would be telling an experience a user had that was extremely 
difficult for them. Each story would be a journey that the user went through. For instance, I could write a story about my educational 
experience and what I've accomplished, didn't accomplish, and learned from the experience. Through these stories, people could find similarities 
or guidance.

### **Main Features**
- All users can 
  - read stories and comments
  - create an account, unless they already have one
- Users with an account can
  - write, edit, and delete their own stories
